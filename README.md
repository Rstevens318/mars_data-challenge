# mars_data-challenge

As exploration of Mars continues, it is important to monitor the weather on the planet. In this challenge, we will showcase our web-scraping and data analytics skills by analyzing the weather data for Mars. To collect the data, we will scrape the [Mars News](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html) and [Mars Weather](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) using Python's Beautiful Soup library. We will extract the relevant information from the sites and store it in a pandas dataframe.
